About the research

Metodology and findings:

Four face-to-face interview and seven qualitative surveys were conducted with potential users. On one hand, a little more than fifty per cent of our sample, indicated being Rick & Morty's fan. On the other hand, the rest of people indicated only 'liked' it. In addition to this, a range between 21 and 26 years old was identified as an age group. However, when making a comparison with universal statistics, the target market that usually watches this sitcom is between the ages of 25 and 35. Therefore, combining both findings, it was established that our target includes any person, without distinguishing age, who is characterized by being 'jovial', a significant personality trait among people who meet the aforementioned age ranges.

Basis for User Stories:

User Stories' definition was based by answering main four questions:
1. What do you like/interest about Rick & Morty?
2. Have you ever searched something regarding Rick & Morty in the web?
3. If you would create your own Rick & Morty website, what would you include inside?
4. When do you consider necessary to use this website?

User Stories

For planning, user stories was defined under Scrum Agile Metodologhy, which was developed through software tool Jira.
